## Introduction
My friend, who knew that I can program, came up with this project,
so he suggested that I create this bot to automatically check for
updates on the game's website and upload them to the discord server.
Despite the lack of knowledge about both writing discord bots and web scraping,
I finally managed to learn it all and finally write this bot.


## Technologies
* Python 3.11.1
* Discord library for Python
